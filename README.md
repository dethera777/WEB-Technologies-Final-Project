## WEB Technologies course at Sofia University (Faculty of Mathematics and Informatics) - winter semester 2020/2021

### Final project
#### This project is developed by me and Diyan Mihaylov. It is our first try to develop something of this kind

* **Theme** of the project: ***University Graduation Process Management***

* **Architecture**
    * *Presentation layer* - developed through **HTML**, **CSS** and **JavaScript**
    * *Database* - **MySQL**
    * *Business logic* - implemented through **PHP**

* **How to use**
    1. you can download *XAMPP software package*, which comes with *Apache server* and *MySQL database*
    2. you should import the file named **web-project-db.sql**, located in **database folder** into **phpmyadmin**
    3. the system should be started by an administrator. The administrator should have a **.csv** file named **graduating students** in which all the graduating students are listed together with their marks. You can change the example file named **graduating students**, located in **backend -> database_files** with your own **.csv** file named the same way
    4. the entry point of the system is the file **login.html**, located in **frontend -> login**
    5. you can run the system on **localhost** and explore it thoroughly
    6. you can learn more about the system from its [documentation](./documentation.pdf) in Bulgarian
